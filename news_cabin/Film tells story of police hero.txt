	Film tells story of police hero
    A seminar on a new biographical movie based on the story of Fan Shufeng, a police officer who was bestowed with the "hero model" title by the Ministry of Public Security, was held in Beijing on Tuesday.
    The movie,
    (a huge event), is directed by Wu Shuang and features veteran actor Shao Feng.
    Fan began his career in 2005 when he joined the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau in Henan province. He participated in multiple pivotal tasks, including being part of the security detail for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and rescue operations during the Wenchuan earthquake.
    After being transferred to a community branch in 2016, he continued to dedicate himself to his work, seizing over 200 suspects and participating in more than 100 cases.
    In February 2020, Fan passed away at his workplace at the age of 39 due to a cerebral hemorrhage that resulted from working consecutively for 17 days during the pandemic. After his death, his family respected his last will to donate his organs, which rescued five patients.
    Guo Tao, the chief producer of the movie, said it took around three years to prepare the film, recalling how the crew overcame various difficulties, including shooting delays amid regional pandemic outbreaks and the withdraw of several investors, to ultimately wrap up the project.
    Rao Shuguang, president of the China Film Critics Association, said there has been an increase in the number of biographical movies that retell role models in recent years. This trend has made it possible for a new genre to emerge, allowing domestic filmmakers to break away from stereotypical narratives and attract a wider audience, he adds.

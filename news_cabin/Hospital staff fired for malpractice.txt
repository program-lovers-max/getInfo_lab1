    Local health administration in Jinyun county of Lishui in Zhejiang has launched an investigation into a medical incident at a local hospital, during which a woman was forgotten and left in a MRI cabin for three hours.
    According to a previous online post made by the woman, she was undergoing a medical examination at a local hospital in Jinyun on April 22 when she was forgotten in the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) capsule for nearly three hours. Ultimately, she had to climb out of the capsule on her own, only to find that the door was locked. Eventually, she called her husband to get a doctor to unlock the door and get out.
    The Shanghai-based Thepaper.cn reported on Thursday that the local health administration in Jinyun has launched an investigation into the case and the hospital was ordered to rectify its malpractices.
    According to the investigation, on April 22 at 4:10 pm, the patient arrived at the hospital for an MRI examination. The scan started at 4:12 pm and completed at 4:18 pm, and then the machine automatically entered into standby mode. Since the staff had neglected to remind the patient to leave, the patient remained in the capsule until 7 pm.
    After the incident, the hospital actively communicated with the woman to reach a compromise, apologizing for their mistake on April 24. The patient's physical condition was found to be normal. Currently, the hospital has dismissed the staff involved in the incident, Thepaper.cn reported.

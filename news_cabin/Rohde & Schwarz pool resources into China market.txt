    Rohde & Schwarz, one of the world's leading manufacturers of test and measurement equipment, plans to bring more air traffic control - or ATC telecommunication - products to China, and pool more resources into enhancing the capabilities of its Chinese employees.
    Stefan Kraemmer, regional area manager of world market ATC at Rohde & Schwarz, said China is one of the company's key markets, and he is upbeat about the immense growth potential from China's civil aviation market.
    "We want to mainly invest in our people, bring them to Europe for training to build up our engineering skills in China, and to do more service activities in China, such as repairing our products in China, and doing some designs for new projects," he said.
    He added that the company will introduce some innovative communication suites, such as air traffic control radio technology, to the Chinese market. It has also carried out cooperation with a research institute affiliated with the Civil Aviation Administration of China to prove that the company's products are compliant with related standards.
    At present, one of the big challenges for Rohde & Schwarz's ATC business in China is the competition from local rivals, Kraemmer said. "However, they also motivate us to invest a lot of money in R&D and to make our own products better so as to stay ahead of the game. So, it's a challenge and a motivation at the same time."
    Founded in 1933, the German company has an extensive sales and service network in more than 70 countries. It has invested heavily in future technologies such as artificial intelligence, the industrial internet of things, 6G, cloud solutions and quantum technology.

    Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted his players were beaten by the better side as they suffered a painful 4-0 demolition at Manchester City on Wednesday that completed a 5-1 aggregate defeat in their Champions League semifinal.
    City, who was beaten by Madrid at the same stage last season, avenged that heartbreaking defeat with a brilliant performance in front of their jubilant fans, with only Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois preventing it inflicting even more damage.
    "They played better than us and deserved to win," Ancelotti admitted to reporters.

	TIME FOR NEW MEMORIES
    Shows in capital mark start of a return tour for Martha Graham dancers with Chinese-born top performer, Chen Nan reports.
    Prior to Wednesday, it had been about five years since the Martha Graham Dance Company last performed at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing. As a way to celebrate the return, the company had two performances on Wednesday and Thursday. These featured three works: Appalachian Spring, Immediate Tragedy and Canticle for Innocent Comedians, which kicked off its China tour.
    Following its Beijing stop, the company will visit Shanghai with two shows on Sunday and Monday and Guangzhou on June 16 and 17.
    As the oldest American contemporary dance company, it was launched by dancer-choreographer Martha Graham (1894-1991) in 1926.

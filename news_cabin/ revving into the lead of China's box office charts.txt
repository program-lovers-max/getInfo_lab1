    Two days after its release in China,
    — the latest outing of the 22-year-old Fast and the Furious franchise — has revved into the lead of the box office, exceeding
    as the new single-day champion in the country.
    The movie has grossed around 150 million yuan ($21.4 million) since it opened to over 50 percent of all Chinese mainland screens including nearly 800 IMAX systems on May 17, two days earlier than the North American release.
    Featuring returning stars Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez, the new movie sees legendary protagonist Dominic Toretto, facing off against an insane and ruthless villain played by Jason Momoa, in order to protect his cherished family and crew.
    On May 15, the movie premiered at Universal CityWalk Cinema in Beijing, displaying a Gold Plated Lamborghini outside the venue in celebration of the franchise. It then held advanced screenings across ten Chinese cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Wuhan.
    An exhibition themed on the new movie has been held in Sunset Boulevard in Universal Studio Beijing's Hollywood area, displaying several major vehicles featured in the franchise, including a 1970 Dodge Charger and a 1967 Ford Fairlane.

    Arab foreign ministers welcomed Syria back to the Arab League on Wednesday and called for a ceasefire in conflict-hit Sudan ahead of the organization's annual summit in Saudi Arabia.
    This year's summit, starting on Friday in the city of Jeddah, will mark the readmittance of war-torn Syria into the 22-member league after a 12-year suspension.
    Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan said on Wednesday that the region is at a crossroads, facing a host of challenges. He called for cooperation among Arab countries to achieve security, stability and economic prosperity.

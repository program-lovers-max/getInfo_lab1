    US-based delivery services provider FedEx Express has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Guangzhou municipal government to work together on Customs clearance and cross-border e-commerce, and establish its operations center in South China, according to a statement by the company on Wednesday.
    The two sides, it said, will jointly promote FedEx's business in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, expand e-commerce logistics services and support the city's development as an international cargo hub.
    "We have actively intensified collaboration with local governments and partners to more efficiently connect Chinese enterprises with the global market, contributing to the increase of China's exports and imports," said Eddy Chan, senior vice-president of FedEx and president of FedEx China.

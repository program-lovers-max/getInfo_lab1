	London curator asks visitors to understand meaning of care
    
    For Chinese curator Wang Naiyi, the word care carries a lot of meanings, takes multiple forms, and could be interpreted through different dimensions. That is the underlying theme of the Care Pavilion that she curated for this year's London Design Biennale, which opened on June 1 and runs until June 25.
    "Having experienced the pandemic, people are taking greater care of their health, and as the climate crisis deepens, people care more about the environment," Wang says. And care, Wang adds, takes on many forms.
    Instead of giving concrete directions, the pavilion, a dark space with meditative music and cube stools, prompts visitors to reflect upon care on their own.

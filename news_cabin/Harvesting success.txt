	HARVESTING SUCCESS
    
    With the wheat harvest in full swing, China had gathered 53.8 percent of its crop as of Wednesday, reaping about 10.93 million hectares of farmland, official data released on Wednesday by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs showed.
    According to the ministry, wheat harvests in Sichuan and Hubei provinces are almost done, while in Anhui province about 90 percent have been completed and in Henan province 80 percent have been finished. In Shandong and Shaanxi provinces, harvests are nearing their peak.
    Taking up about a quarter of the country's total annual grain output, the harvest is hugely significant in achieving the annual grain production target. Traditionally, the summer harvest spans the period from late May to mid-June.

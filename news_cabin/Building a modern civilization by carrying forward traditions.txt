	Building a modern civilization by carrying forward traditions
    
    At a recent symposium on cultural inheritance and development, President Xi Jinping said that the cultural missions in the new era are to further advance cultural prosperity, to build a leading country in culture and to foster the modern Chinese civilization.
    Xi's remarks provide important guidance for action as we shoulder the new cultural mission and strive to build a modern civilization for the Chinese nation.
    Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, the top authorities have placed cultural construction in an important position in the overall scheme of things, and put forward a series of new thoughts, new viewpoints and new assertions. These viewpoints are the theoretical summary of the practical experience of the Party-led cultural construction in the new era, and also the fundamental guidelines for us to observe in our ideological and cultural work, and they must be adhered to and enriched for a long time ahead.

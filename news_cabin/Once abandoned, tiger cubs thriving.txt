	Once abandoned, tiger cubs thriving
    Five tiger cubs abandoned by their mother shortly after birth are now in good health in Chongqing.
    The cubs were born in the Chongqing Locajoy Theme Park in the city's Yongchuan district on April 28.
    The mother, a Bengal tiger that was born in the park as well, had refused to feed her offspring, probably due to lack of milk after multiple births. Five zookeepers rushed to the rescue and fed the cubs, according to Shen Wei, the leader of the keepers.
    "The baby tigers are now in good condition," said Shen. "And they haven't been named yet."

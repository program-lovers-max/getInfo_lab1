	Menstrual health and climate crisis
    
    Menstruation is too often treated as a taboo topic and this stigma is pronounced in emergencies, where the challenges of managing menstruation are amplified. Asia and the Pacific is especially vulnerable to climate change, with droughts, floods and extreme storms that will continue to devastate critical infrastructure. In disaster responses across the region, menstrual health is under-resourced, with dire consequences for the health of women and girls.
    The World Bank estimates that more than 500 million women and girls around the world lack access to menstrual supplies and adequate facilities for menstrual hygiene management, a number expected to increase as the climate crisis intensifies.
    From the flooded fields of Pakistan to the cyclone-ravaged islands of Vanuatu, women struggle to manage their menstruation safely, comfortably and with dignity. In emergency situations, the lack of access to basic menstrual supplies can lead to a range of health problems including urinary and reproductive tract infections.

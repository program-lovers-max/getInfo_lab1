    China will continue optimizing its power battery industry management policies to further facilitate the rapid development of the sector, said a government official on Friday.
    China is keen to optimize the management policies of the power battery industry, strengthening the overall planning of the industry's development while guiding rational investment to avoid blind expansion and disorderly development, said Xin Guobin, vice-minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, on Friday during a power battery forum in Yibin, Sichuan province.

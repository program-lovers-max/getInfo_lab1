	Angolan youth relish chance to display knowledge of Chinese culture
    
    LUANDA â€” Wearing traditional Chinese clothes, more than 50 students from a university in Angola participated in a competition to showcase their knowledge about Chinese culture.
    During the first recitation competition on Chinese literature held by the Confucius Institute at Agostinho Neto University, students on Saturday recited pieces by heart from the ancient Analects of Confucius, dating back more than 2,400 years, to contemporary Chinese poetry. Their performances impressed audiences from all walks of life in Angola.
    In his opening speech, Pedro Magalhaes, rector of the Agostinho Neto University, hailed the event as a grand cultural gathering. He emphasized that poetry and music are the most potent forms of global communication, and the students from the Confucius Institute symbolize the cultural exchange between Angola and China.

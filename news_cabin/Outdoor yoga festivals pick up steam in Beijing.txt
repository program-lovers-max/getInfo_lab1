	Outdoor yoga festivals pick up steam in Beijing
    
    Over the last few months, there have been a number of outdoor yoga events in Beijing, among them Wake-up Spring in March, Sweat in April, Inside-Flow last month, and the Beijing Ocean Yoga Festival this month. Post-COVID, yoga enthusiasts — mainly women aged between 20 and 40 — appear more willing to participate in these events, both to promote a healthy lifestyle and to share in the energy and benefits of physical activity.
    On Saturday, the Beijing Ocean Yoga Festival, an event organized by yoga brands including Mona Yoga and Kamal Yoga, was held at the Taipingyang Andover Under Water World.
    From morning till sunset, dozens of athletes, celebrity yoga teachers, and nearly 1,000 yoga enthusiasts exercised together, exchanged ideas, and enjoyed a very healthy day.

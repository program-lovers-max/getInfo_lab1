	Chinese and Russian Generals hold talks
    General Liu Zhenli, chief of staff of the Central Military Commission's Joint Staff Department, talked with his Russian counterpart Army General Valery Gerasimov through video link on Friday, according to China's Ministry of National Defense.
    The two generals exchanged their views on implementing the consensuses reached by State leaders and deepening military cooperations. They also confirmed Russian military forces' participation in the "North-Joint 2023" exercise held by China's People's Liberation Army, the ministry said in a brief news release, without giving more details about the conversation.
    According to public information from the Chinese military, this has been the first time for Liu to talk with any foreign military commander since he was named a leader of the Central Military Commission, China's top military authority, in March.
    Gerasimov is the highest ranking officer of the Russian Armed Forces.
    Earlier this week, China and Russia conducted joint strategic air patrols over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea.
    The Chinese air force deployed H-6K bombers and J-11B fighter jets while the Russian military deployed Tu-95MS bombers, and Su-35S and Su-30SM fighter jets during the two-day operation.

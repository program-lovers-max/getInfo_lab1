	US country musician connects western China and Oklahoma
    Kyle Dillingham, the famous American fiddler, has performed in more than 40 countries, including China, and made history in the Opry by skateboarding to the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, the world-famous palace of country music. In an exclusive interview with China Daily, he said that one of his favorite Chinese words is lao peng you, meaning "old friend". He said the relationship between real old friends often has ups and downs, just like the relationship between China and the United States, but the friendship will always last. In recent years, Dillingham has visited China many times, making important contributions to enhancing the friendship between the two peoples.

	Motorola unveils latest foldable smartphones
    Smartphone brand Motorola has unveiled its latest foldable smartphone moto razr 40 series in China in a bid for a bigger slice of the world's largest smartphone market.
    The new devices are part of Motorola's broader push to attract more tech-savvy consumers amid intensified competition and a depressed market.
    Zhang Hua, vice-president of Lenovo and general manager of consumer business group in Lenovo China, said the new moto razr series are good products that can fit into everyday connection, and integrate human and computer.
    Global foldable smartphone shipments are projected to rise to 26 million units in 2023, according to a report from market research company Counterpoint Research.
    Foldable smartphones are still the fastest-growing smartphone product category this year, with the strong growth defying current economic headwinds as the high-end phone market shows resilience and a steady demand, said the report.

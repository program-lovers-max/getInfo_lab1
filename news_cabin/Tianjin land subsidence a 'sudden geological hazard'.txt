	Tianjin land subsidence a 'sudden geological hazard'
    
    A preliminary judgment was made on Thursday that a case of land subsidence, which began in Jinnan district in Tianjin on May 31, was the result of a "sudden geological hazard", according to local news outlet Jinyun.
    "Preliminary findings indicate that the sudden geological hazard was a result of the complicated geological structure deep underground. Based on the findings of scientific institutes, geologists suspect that there may be a geological cavity about 1,300 meters underground, which ordinary exploration was unable to discover," an expert told Jinyun.
    "We can't exclude the possibility that geothermal well drilling projects came into contact with the deep geological structure, resulting in soil erosion and subsidence at ground level," the expert continued.

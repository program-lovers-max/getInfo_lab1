	Analysts: Economy set for faster growth pace in Q2
    
    China's consumer inflation edged up marginally while factory-gate prices dropped further in May amid weak demand, suggesting that more stimulus policies may be needed to boost domestic demand and broaden the economic recovery, analysts said on Friday.
    Despite taking a cautious view on both consumer spending and external demand during the rest of the year, they expect that China's economy will expand notably at a faster pace in the second quarter given the continued recovery trend and a low comparison base in the previous year. And the country will likely meet its annual growth target of around 5 percent for 2023, they added.
    Their comments came as China's consumer price index, a main gauge of inflation, climbed 0.2 percent from a year earlier in May after the 0.1 percent gain in April, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday.

	Wildfire smoke blankets East Coast
    
    Smoke from Canadian wildfires shrouded cities in the United States in a noxious haze again on Thursday, delaying flights and disrupting outdoor events in what US President Joe Biden called a "stark reminder" of climate change.
    Thick skies and an acrid campfire smell hung over the capital Washington, with parts of the mid-Atlantic region reaching "Code Maroon", the highest category of the Air Quality Index, or AQI, signaling hazardous conditions.
    This exceeded some of the most polluted cities in the world, leading many residents to wear masks to protect their health. Though there has been some improvement, conditions are not expected to return to normal until the weekend, forecasters said.

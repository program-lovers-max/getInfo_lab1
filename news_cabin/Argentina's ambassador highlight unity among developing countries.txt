	Argentina's ambassador highlight unity among developing countries
    Sabino Vaca Narvaja, Argentina's ambassador to China, has underlined the need for emerging economies and developing countries like China and Argentina to join hands in overcoming challenges.
    "Our future is the developing countries working together, that's why I believe the Belt and Road projects are very important for our countries," he told China Daily on the sidelines of an event in Beijing on Thursday.
    He noted that both countries "have a complementary economy".
    "We have the same difficulty, we have the same problem, and we have to affront together," he said.
    "We have to work together -- this is important. And I think the developing countries have a very strong future if we work together," he said.

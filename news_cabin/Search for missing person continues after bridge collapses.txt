	Search for missing person continues after bridge collapses
    Rescuers were still searching for a person who was washed away when an ancient bridge collapsed in Nanxiong city, Guangdong province, as of Friday noon.
    According to a statement released by the Nanxiong Bureau of Emergency Management, the victim is one of two people who fell into the water when part of the Shuixi bridge, located in the suburbs of Nanxiong, collapsed at 7:20 pm on Thursday.
    The other victim who was sent to hospital after being rescued is now under medical observation and out of danger, said the statement.
    Investigation of the case is still continuing, it said.
    The 5-meter-high Shuixi bridge, which reaches 104 meters long and is 4.3 meters wide, was built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). And the bridge, which was listed as a provincial-level cultural relic in 2018, underwent repairs by relevant departments three years ago.

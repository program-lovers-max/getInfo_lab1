	Russia: Floods caused by dam burst kill 5
    
    At least 600 square kilometers of the Kherson region have been flooded following a major dam collapse as Russia reports five dead in the flooding.
    Floodwaters have risen to an average level of 5.61 meters and roughly 600 square kilometers were submerged, Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said in a statement on Telegram.
    The collapse of the Kakhovka dam and hydroelectric plant sent torrents of water gushing down the Dnipro River. Meanwhile, the east bank, which sits lower than the west, suffered the worst of the flooding.

	US sees 110,000 overdose deaths in 2022
    
    Nearly 110,000 people died from drug overdoses last year in the United States, as experts suggest drug use was worsened by the stress, anxiety and worry of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.
    Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 109,680 deaths were caused by drug overdoses in 2022. It was 2 percent higher than the 107,622 overdose deaths in 2021.
    Data also show that the largest number of drug overdoses in 2022 were due to fentanyl and synthetic opioids. Fentanyl is involved in more deaths of US people under age 50 than suicide, homicide or cancer, the Drug Enforcement Administration said.

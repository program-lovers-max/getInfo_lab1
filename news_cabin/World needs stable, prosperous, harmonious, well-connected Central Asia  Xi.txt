    XI'AN -- Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Friday that the world needs a Central Asia that is stable, prosperous, harmonious, and well-connected.
    Xi made the remarks while delivering a keynote address at the China-Central Asia Summit held in the city of Xi'an, Northwest China's Shaanxi province.
    Noting that the world needs a stable Central Asia, Xi said the sovereignty, security, independence and territorial integrity of Central Asian countries must be safeguarded, the development paths independently chosen by Central Asian people must be respected, and the efforts made by the region to pursue peace, amity and tranquility must be supported.
    Stressing that the world needs a prosperous Central Asia, Xi said such a Central Asia will meet the aspiration of people of different countries in the region for a better life, and inject strong impetus into world economic recovery.
    Noting that the world needs a harmonious Central Asia, Xi said ethnic conflicts, religious disputes and cultural division are not the main theme in Central Asia, while solidarity, inclusiveness and amity are the pursuit of the Central Asian people.
    Stressing that the world needs a well-connected Central Asia, Xi said that the region, blessed with unique geographical advantages, has the foundation, conditions and capabilities to become an important hub for the connectivity of the Eurasian continent, and to make Central Asian contributions to the exchanges of goods, the interactions between civilizations and the development of science and technology in the world.

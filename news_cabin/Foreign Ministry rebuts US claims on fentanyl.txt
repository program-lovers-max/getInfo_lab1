	Foreign Ministry rebuts US claims on fentanyl
    
    Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Thursday dismissed the accusation made by the United States that China is failing to control fentanyl, saying that the root cause of this issue lies within the US itself and urging Washington to show sincerity in cooperation instead of attempting to shift the blame to China.
    Speaking at a regular news briefing in Beijing, Wang said that China was the first country in the world to have officially scheduled fentanyl-related substances as a class in 2019 to prevent their illegal production, trafficking and abuse. "And the US was an important beneficiary country," he said.
    The US has been criticizing China over the drug and the latest accusation was made by the US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns. Speaking to an audience in Washington via video link on Wednesday, Burns said the US side has not seen progress made by the Chinese government on this issue.

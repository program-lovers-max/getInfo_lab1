	Legacy still relevant today after 5,000 years
    
    Important archaeological discoveries of societies dating back 5,000 to 6,000 years have been made in many regions of China.
    Among them, Hongshan Culture sites are among the oldest and are helping to form a relatively comprehensive, systematic archaeological picture related to the origin of the Chinese civilization.
    Since the 1980s, large-scale sacrificial ceremonial grounds have been found at the Niuheliang archaeological site in Chaoyang city, Northeast China's Liaoning province, with excavations uncovering an altar, a temple, rubble mound tombs, jade ritual ware and painted potteries.

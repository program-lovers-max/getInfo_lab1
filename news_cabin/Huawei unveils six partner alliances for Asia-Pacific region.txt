    Huawei Technologies Co launched six new partner alliances for the Asia-Pacific region on Wednesday in its latest push to nurture a robust innovation system to accelerate industrial digital transformation.
    Huawei said at its Asia Pacific Partners Conference 2023 in Shenzhen, Guangdong province that the six new partner alliances are for the government; finance; electric power; and road, waterway and port industries, as well as for the independent software vendor and data center facility solution sectors.
    David Wang, executive director of the board and president of the enterprise business group at Huawei, said: "Digital and intelligent transformation is creating waves that will sweep across the globe. Together, they will create a market space exceeding one trillion US dollars. Huawei wants to work with partners to seize these huge opportunities."
    "For the Asia-Pacific market, we have designed unique partner development strategies for three major markets, namely the named account market, commercial market and distribution business. This helps address their unique needs in a more targeted fashion," Wang added.
    Huawei said it has more than 7,900 enterprise partners and more than 2,000 cloud partners in the Asia-Pacific region, and it seeks to cultivate an even stronger partner ecosystem here.
    Huawei also has committed to increasing its investment in partnerships and incentives for partners. It hopes this will create greater value for customers, further promote the region's digital economy development and unleash digital productivity.
    According to Huawei, over 70 partners from across the Asia-Pacific attended event and pledged to continue cooperation and innovation in numerous domains. Their goal is to join hands to develop capabilities and seize opportunities from industrial digital transformation in the Asia-Pacific market.

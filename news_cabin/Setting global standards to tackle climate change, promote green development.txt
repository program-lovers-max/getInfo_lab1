	Setting global standards to tackle climate change, promote green development
    Officials and experts from around the world came together in Qingdao, Shandong province, on Friday, to address climate change and promote low-carbon development through international standardization.
    At the 2023 Qingdao Forum on International Standardization, Sergio Mujica, secretary-general of the International Standardization Organization, emphasized the crucial role that international standards can play in tackling climate change.
    In an interview with China Daily, he stated that ISO has made a portfolio of standards available to the world, offering a set of highly relevant international standards that are ready to be implemented.
    Mujica highlighted the collaborative nature of ISO, stating that it not only relies on existing standards but also has the capacity to create new standards through consensus, inclusivity, and transparency.
    He emphasized the importance of working with developing countries, particularly the most vulnerable states, in order to enable their participation in addressing climate change.

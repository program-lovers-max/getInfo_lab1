    Nick Kyrgios' French Open withdrawal was because of a cut foot sustained when a man allegedly stole his car at gunpoint, his agent says, rather than knee surgery.
    The French Tennis Federation said earlier this week the Australian would miss Roland Garros due to surgery in January to repair a torn left meniscus.
    But his agent told The Canberra Times the knee was "fine" and a nasty cut to the foot was why he would not be in Paris.

    China, which cherishes peace across the Taiwan Strait, will not allow anyone to meddle in its domestic affairs under the guise of maintaining peace, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Thursday.
    Those who seek cross-Strait peace without opposing "Taiwan independence" separatist moves will only encourage and embolden the separatists, and bring about more damage to peace and stability across the Strait, Wang said at a regular news conference.
    Wang made the remarks after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said in an interview with NHK that he wants to send a message at the upcoming Group of Seven Summit that the Taiwan question should be resolved peacefully through dialogue.

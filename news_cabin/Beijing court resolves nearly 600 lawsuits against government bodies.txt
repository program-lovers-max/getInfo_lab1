    The Beijing No 4 Intermediate People's Court handled nearly 600 lawsuits filed by residents and enterprises against government agencies last year, most of which involved land expropriation and the demolition of homes.
    The court revealed the figure on Thursday while introducing a report on administrative case hearings to public.
    The report showed that more than 30 percent of the 597 lawsuits accepted by the court in 2022 were related to land expropriation and home demolition, with 69 regarding illegal construction and 129 concerning housing management.
    The rest involved environmental protection, village governance and the administrative affairs of public security departments, the report said, adding that 588 of the lawsuits have been resolved.
    It said that government agencies lost 54 of the suits. The ones they lost mainly concerned the renovation of shanty areas and environmental improvements.
    It was determined that some agencies did not perform their duties or were not clear on their roles, while others handled their administrative affairs improperly, the report said.
    Though the agencies lost the suits, they recognized their problems and quickly rectified them, helping to better build a governance system that operates by rule of law, the report added.

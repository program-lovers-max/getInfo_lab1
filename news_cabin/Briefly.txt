    Japan is set to receive injured Ukrainian soldiers at a Tokyo hospital run by its military, a senior member of Japan's ruling coalition said on Thursday.

Details were expected to be decided at a meeting between Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada and Ukrainian Ambassador to Japan Sergiy Korsunsky later on Thursday, but costs will likely be shouldered mostly by the Japanese side, the lawmaker added.

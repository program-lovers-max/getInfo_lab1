	McDonald's to feature MSC label on food packages
    Food products from McDonald's will feature the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) label on their packages to promote the company's sustainability goals, McDonald's China announced on Thursday, which marked World Ocean Day.
    The blue label is used for wild fish or seafood from fisheries that have been certified with the MSC Fisheries Standard, a set of requirements for sustainable fishing.
    McDonald's China has over 5,000 restaurants that regularly prepares burgers using pollock. The company on average consumes around 3,500 tonnes of processed fish filets per year.
    Gu Lei, chief impact officer of McDonald's China, pointed out that McDonald's also has over 2,000 certified Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) stores and that the company is "continuously striving for sustainable development in packaging paper and recycling."

	Nation ramps up foreign medical aid
    
    China plans to ramp up its foreign medical aid drive, including mobilizing resources from public and private sectors, providing assistance in public health and traditional medicine, as well as nurturing more talent, a senior health official said recently.
    Ma Xiaowei, minister of the National Health Commission, made the comments in a signed article published on Monday as this year marks the 60th anniversary of China sending its first medical team abroad to Algeria in 1963.
    "By the end of 1978, China had dispatched medical aid groups to over 30 countries in Asia and Africa, and funded the establishment of more than 20 hospitals or medical centers overseas," he said in the article published in People's Daily newspaper.

	Improved lives at 'roof of world' reflect inclusive growth
    
    Like many of his fellow villagers two decades ago, a farmer named Kunsang, who is of the Monba ethnic group, subsisted on a small plot of land, growing corn, rapeseed, highland barley and other basic crops.
    "We had no real income back then, just living day to day," the 37-year-old says.
    The past hardships that Kunsang had to endure may seem hard to believe if you visit his two-story house of nine rooms in the village of Shelkar Monba in Nyingchi, Tibet autonomous region.

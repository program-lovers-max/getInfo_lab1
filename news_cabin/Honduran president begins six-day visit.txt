	Honduran president begins six-day visit
    
    President of the Republic of Honduras Iris Xiomara Castro Sarmiento arrived in Shanghai on Friday to kick off her six-day visit to China.
    This is Castro's first visit to China since the two nations officially established diplomatic relations on March 26, shortly after Honduras severed its "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan region.
    The visiting president received a warm welcome when arriving at her hotel in Shanghai, where the Shanghai Old Jazz Band played a Honduran song which was used as background music for Castro's inauguration ceremony as president of Honduras in January 2022.

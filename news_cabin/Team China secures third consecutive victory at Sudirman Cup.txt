    The Chinese badminton team maintained its formidable form at the ongoing 2023 BWF Sudirman Cup in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, as they clinched their third consecutive win in the group stage by defeating Denmark 5-0 on Thursday.
    The world's number one mixed doubles pair, Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong, secured the first point for Team China by defeating Mathias Thyrri and Amalie Magelund of Denmark with a score of 21-9, 21-19.
    Chinese men's singles ace, Li Shifeng, claimed victory in the second match against Rasmus Gemke, with scores of 21-15, 16-21, 21-15. Denmark's world number one men's singles player, Viktor Axelsen, did not compete on Thursday.
    Olympic champion Chen Yufei extended Team China's lead by winning the third point in the women's singles category, triumphing over Line Christophersen with a score of 21-8, 21-11. In the fourth match, the Chinese men's doubles pair of Liu Yuchen and Ou Xuanyi, ranked fifth in the world, emerged victorious. Finally, the Chinese women's doubles pair of Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan won the fifth match.
    "Actually, today's match was easier than I expected, as I had prepared for the toughest situation. I haven't played against her before, so I'm not familiar with her style. She's fast and aggressive, so I needed to give my best," said Chinese women's singles player Chen Yufei.
    "Compared to individual competitions, I feel even more excited during the mixed team event. My teammates are all there, cheering for me, which boosts my confidence and positivity."
    Team China commenced their Sudirman Cup campaign in Suzhou with a 5-0 victory over Egypt on May 14. In the second Group A match on Tuesday, they defeated Singapore with a score of 5-0. With Thursday's triumph, the Chinese squad emerged victorious in all 15 matches during the group stage, securing the top spot in Group A. The final match will take place on Sunday.
    China, the reigning Sudirman Cup champion, holds the record for being the most successful team in the event's history, having won 12 out of the last 17 editions of the tournament.

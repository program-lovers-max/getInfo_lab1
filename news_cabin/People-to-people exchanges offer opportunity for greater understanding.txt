    When Karakoz Askarbekkyzy hesitated about whether to go to Europe or China for further studies more than 10 years ago, her mother encouraged her to go to China, citing the "promising opportunities" for learning the Chinese language and culture.
    Karakoz, a 29-year-old Kazakhstani, embarked on her long journey in the neighboring country and has since developed a strong passion for Chinese culture.
    "It was not all smooth sailing at the beginning. When I arrived in China, I found that the biggest challenge was the language barrier because Chinese language was way too hard for me," said Karakoz, who now speaks fluent Mandarin, in an interview with China Daily.

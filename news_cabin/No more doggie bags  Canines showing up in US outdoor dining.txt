    It has become more popular for Americans to take their dogs to restaurants, and a US regulator has issued new guidelines to ease restrictions. Yelp searches for businesses using the “dogs allowed” filter jumped 58 percent between May 1, 2021, and May 1, 2023. The US Food and Drug Administration issued guidance late last year saying dogs pose a low health risk to diners and that restaurants can allow dogs in outdoor dining areas after obtaining approval from local regulators.

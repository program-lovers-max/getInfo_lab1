	Enveloped in smoke from Ottawa to Toronto
    
    Burning smoke has choked the entire region from Ottawa to Toronto, as Canada deals with one of its worst wildfire seasons on record that is sending haze and smoke throughout the United States' northeast.
    As of Wednesday, 414 wildfires were burning in Canada with 239 out of control, keeping 20,183 Canadians out of their homes, Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said. So far this year, 2,293 wildfires have torched 3.8 million hectares of land.
    Environment Canada has issued special air quality advisories for large areas of Ontario and Quebec, warning of high levels of pollution from wildfires burning across both provinces.

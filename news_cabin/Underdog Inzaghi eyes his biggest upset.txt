    Getting Inter Milan to Saturday's Champions League final is the latest achievement in Simone Inzaghi's understated managerial career which has highlighted his ability to perform against the odds.
    Inzaghi, 47, spent his playing career firmly in the shadow of his older brother Filippo, a prolific scorer for Italy's biggest clubs, a two-time European champion and World Cup winner.
    The younger Inzaghi, also a striker, played most of his career for Lazio, where he is loved by fans despite a modest goal record and a single league title won 23 years ago.

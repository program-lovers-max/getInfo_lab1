    Xiaodu Technology, the smart speaker unit of Chinese tech heavyweight Baidu Inc, has officially released its education-oriented smartphone equipped with an artificial intelligence-powered large language model that is targeted at students, in a bid to carve out a niche in the world's largest smartphone market.
    Jing Kun, CEO of Xiaodu Technology, said the new smartphone, called Xiaodu Qinghe, will provide AI-enabled tutoring, English-speaking training and interactive learning guidance for primary and middle school students, as the company aims to extend its footprint in the education hardware segment.
    Jing said Baidu's AI large language models will be applied to the company's intelligent terminal devices, such as tablets, smart speakers and headsets in the future. The phone is installed with numerous free learning resources and offers parental controls that can limit the time spent on specific apps. It will go on sale on e-commerce site JD starting next Monday, Xiaodu said.

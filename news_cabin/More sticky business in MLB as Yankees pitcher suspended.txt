    NEW YORK â€” New York Yankees pitcher Domingo German was suspended for 10 games Wednesday by Major League Baseball and fined for violating the sport's prohibition of foreign substances on the mound.
    The penalty was announced following German's ejection in the fourth inning on Tuesday night at Toronto for what an umpire said was "the stickiest hand I've ever felt".
    "My fingers had a hard time coming off his palm," crew chief James Hoye explained after the game.

    President Xi Jinping said on Friday that the world needs a stable, harmonious, prosperous and interconnected Central Asia as the transformation of the world unseen in a century is unfolding at a faster pace.
    He made the remarks in a keynote speech when chairing the China-Central Asia Summit in Xi'an, Shaanxi province.
    Changes of the world, of our times, and of the historical trajectory are taking place in ways like never before, he said, noting that Central Asia, the center of the Eurasian continent, is at a crossroads connecting the East and West, the South and North.
    To build a stable Central Asia, Xi said the sovereignty, security, independence and territorial integrity of Central Asian countries must be upheld, their people's choice of development paths must be respected and their efforts for peace, harmony and tranquility must be supported.
    Noting that the world needs a prosperous Central Asia, Xi said a dynamic and prospering Central Asia will help people in the region achieve their aspiration for a better life and will also lend strong impetus to global economic recovery.
    Citing a Central Asia saying which goes "brotherhood is more precious than any treasure", the president said ethnic conflicts, religious strife, and cultural estrangement are not the defining feature of the region.
    Instead, solidarity, inclusiveness, and harmony are the pursuits of the Central Asian people, he said, adding that no one has the right to sow discord or stoke confrontation in the region, let alone seek selfish political interests.
    Xi noted that Central Asia, blessed with unique geographical advantages, has the right foundation, condition and capability to become an important connectivity hub of Eurasia.
    The region can also make unique contribution to the trading of goods, the interplay of civilizations and the development of science and technology in the world, he said.

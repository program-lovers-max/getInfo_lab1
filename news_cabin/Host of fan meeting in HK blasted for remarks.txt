	Host of fan meeting in HK blasted for remarks
    
    The host of a meeting of fans of Thai idol duo BKPP in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region drew sharp criticism after a video went viral showing him making separatist remarks at the meeting and discriminating against mainland fans.
    The event for two popular Thai idols — Billkin & PP Krit — who go by "BKPP", was held on Tuesday at Hong Kong's Kowloon Bay International Trade& Exhibition Centre.
    After taking the stage, the anchor, a Cantonese-speaking man, immediately asked if there were any people from Taiwan and Hong Kong, and then deliberately dragged his voice and asked whether anyone was from China.

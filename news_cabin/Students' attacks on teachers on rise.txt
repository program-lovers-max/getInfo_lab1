	Students' attacks on teachers on rise
    
    In January, a 6-year-old Virginia student shot his teacher, nearly killing her. Then in February, a Florida student stomped on a teacher's aide over a Nintendo Switch. And in April, a Texas high school student punched his teacher after being told not to use his cellphone in class.
    Such violence by students against educators has been on the rise across the United States, as students return to in-person learning after studying online for a year during the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Some observers blame lax discipline in school, some point to the pandemic's psychological impact on students and some blame parents for always being on their children's side. Regardless of the cause, it seems that teaching has become a hazardous profession in the US today.

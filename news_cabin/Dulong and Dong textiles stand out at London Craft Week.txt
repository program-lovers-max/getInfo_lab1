    By working with local female weavers from the Dulong River Valley, the studio blends traditional craftsmanship with contemporary tastes and increases the income of the weavers.
    So far the Dulong project has been hosted in six installments, attracting a total of 38 weavers of various ethnic minority groups including Dulong, Dong, Naxi and Wa. All earnings from textile goods sales have been used to compensate weavers and support the project’s sustainable growth.

During this year’s event, exhibitions, workshops and lectures were held across the British capital, attracting nearly 120,000 visitors.

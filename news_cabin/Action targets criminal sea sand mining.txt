	Action targets criminal sea sand mining
    Document unifies legal standards against the illegal marine activity
    The Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the China Coast Guard issued a document to unify legal standards and support the crackdown on the illegal mining of sea sand on Thursday, which marks the 15th United Nations World Oceans Day.
    The document's provisions include the application of charges, how to determine intention and the required treatment after sand mining.
    Wan Chun, a senior SPP prosecutor, said that illegal activities related to sea sand have occurred frequently in recent years, threatening the safety of the marine environment and maritime navigation, and breeding criminal organizations.

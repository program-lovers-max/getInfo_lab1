    ANKARA â€” Turkiye is looking forward to tapping into key summer tourism industry revenues to prop up its ailing economy as foreign tourists have begun to flow to sunny Turkish holiday resorts, industry professionals said.
    The crucial industry, which employs 2.6 million workers, generates billions of dollars each year, offering much-needed respite for the economy.
    Turkiye's tourism income rose to $46.3 billion last year, a surge of more than 50 percent from $30 billion in 2021, according to official data released in late January.

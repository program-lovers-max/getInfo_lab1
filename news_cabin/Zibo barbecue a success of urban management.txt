	Zibo barbecue a success of urban management
    
    Zibo, an industrial city in Shandong province, has attained fame for something unusual, if not unique: its barbecue outlets. The GDP of Zibo in the first quarter of this year was 105.77 billion yuan ($15.29 billion), up 4.7 percent year-on-year, laying the ground for further growth as the consumption craze continues.
    Zibo has long sought to popularize its unique barbecued skewers of meat, vegetables, seafood and other foodstuff in the hope of attracting more business. But it was not until March that the city became a hit on social media, attracting on average 135,800 customers a day thanks to the local government's determination and creative methods to boost consumption, and the post-pandemic tourism revival in China.
    One reason for the success of Zibo is that the local government encourages street vending, which is considered an eyesore in many other cities due to concerns about hygiene, sanitation and public convenience. The supervision of "irregular" businesses is a gray zone in many cities, but Zibo responds to the challenge in its own way.

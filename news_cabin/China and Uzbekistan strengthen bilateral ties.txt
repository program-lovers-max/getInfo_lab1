    China stands ready to work with Uzbekistan to deepen all-around cooperation and jointly build a China-Uzbekistan community with a shared future, President Xi Jinping said on Thursday.
    Xi made the remarks during his talks with Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in Xi'an, Shaanxi province. Mirziyoyev is in Xi'an, the provincial capital, to attend China-Central Asia Summit and pay a state visit to China.
    Xi recalled his state visit to Uzbekistan in September, when the two presidents announced the building of a China-Uzbekistan community with a shared future, defining a new characterization of bilateral ties.

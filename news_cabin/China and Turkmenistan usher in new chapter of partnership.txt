    President Xi Jinping on Thursday hailed relations between China and Turkmenistan as "having tremendous potentials for development" and "enjoying a broad prospect", saying China is willing to work with Turkmenistan to constantly promote bilateral ties to deliver more benefits to the two peoples.
    Xi made the remarks while meeting with visiting Turkmen President Serdar Berdimuhamedov in Xi'an, Shaanxi province. Berdimuhamedov is in Xi'an, the provincial capital, to attend China-Central Asia Summit.
    Xi recalled his meeting with the Turkmen president in Beijing in January, when the latter paid a state visit to China. During the meeting, the two leaders announced the elevating of bilateral ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, and the two countries decided to develop a China-Turkmenistan community with a shared future, ushering in a new chapter of bilateral ties.
    Since the two countries established diplomatic ties 31 years ago, both countries have developed friendly cooperation in the principle of mutual respect, mutual benefit and win-win results, he said.

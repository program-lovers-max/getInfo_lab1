	Extend key linkages for RCEP members
    
    Local governments and friendship cities of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership member countries must speed up steps to boost cooperation in industrial and supply chains to help private companies, especially micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, officials and experts said on Friday.
    "Local governments and friendship cities of RCEP member countries should further promote the integration of industrial chains and supply chains, strengthen convenience and efficiency of trade and investment among regions, and explore more international economic and trade opportunities among local governments, industries and enterprises," said Wang Qingxian, governor of Anhui province. "RCEP's scale and foundation determine that its influence will be global, inclusive and open."
    Wang also said that local governments and friendship cities of RCEP member countries should make better use of the role of an effective market and responsible government to seize such opportunities.

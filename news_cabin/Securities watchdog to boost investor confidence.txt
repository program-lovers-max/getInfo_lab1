	Securities watchdog to boost investor confidence
    
    The China Securities Regulatory Commission vowed more measures on Thursday to enhance the quality of listed firms and strengthen crackdown over illegal transactions, which experts said is crucial for reinforcing investor confidence.
    "We are making every effort to provide investors with authentic and transparent listed companies," Yi Huiman, chairman of the CSRC, said at the two-day 14th Lujiazui Forum 2023 in Shanghai.
    Yi said the commission will diligently implement a three-year action plan to improve the quality of listed companies and enhance the long-term, comprehensive regulatory mechanism with relevant parties to boost information disclosure quality and strictly crack down on misdeeds like financial fraud.

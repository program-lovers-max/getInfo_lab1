    The fifth 5.23 Art Festival will be held by the Central Conservatory of Music from May 23 to June 6 in Yan'an, Shaanxi province; Weihai, Shandong province; and Beijing.
    Over 30 Chinese institutions, such as the Renmin University of China, the Central Academy of Fine Arts and Yan'an University, will perform in the festival, covering a diversity of art forms, such as theater, music, dance and traditional Chinese operas.
    First launched in 2019, the festival has been held for four years. The date of the festival, May 23, aims at marking the celebrated speech made by the late Chairman Mao Zedong on art and literature on May 23, 1942, in Yan'an, a revolutionary base in Shaanxi province.
    On June 6, a forum highlighting original Chinese music will be held, gathering Chinese musicians, including composers Guan Xia, Zhao Lin and Wang Danhong.

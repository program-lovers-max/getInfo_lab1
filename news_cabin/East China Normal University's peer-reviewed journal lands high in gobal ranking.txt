	East China Normal University's peer-reviewed journal lands high in gobal ranking
    ECNU Review of Education, an international, peer-reviewed journal established by the East China Normal University in Shanghai, entered the first quarter on a ranking of global educational academic journals being cited for the first time.
    The ranking titled "CiteScore 2022" was released by Scopus, the world's largest literature abstract and citation database, on Thursday.
    ECNU ROE, the open-access journal seeking to facilitate in-depth dialogues among various stakeholders and build a global community of scholars interested in advancing knowledge, generating big ideas, inducing deep changes and exerting real impact in education, was ranked in the 355th place among the total 1,469 journals, up 30 percent year on year.
    Launched in 2018, the journal accepts empirical and conceptual papers, integrated research reviews, and scoping reviews, policy reviews, and voices. It is interested in scholarships that theorize educational experiences in non-English speaking contexts and timely reviews of important educational researches, policies and issues. It also welcomes proposals for themed group articles from large-scale research or emerging interests.
    ECNU said that the journal is so far the only English language international journal in education research fields supervised by the Ministry of Education and undertaken by the university.
    China, the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom are the main countries where the authors submitting their papers and reviews are from, and the downloads and citations have been globally distributed, with the US, Asia and Europe being the main regions, according to the university.
    "The journal has become a much needed bridge between scholars in China and across regional and international contexts, cultivating an intellectual community based on the values of multidirectional knowledge exchange and deep cross-cultural dialogue," said Iveta Silova, president elect of the Comparative and International Education Society of US.

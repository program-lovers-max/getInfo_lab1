    More than 200 participants from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, including members of pro-reunification political parties, experts and students attended Dajiang Forum, a platform to discuss the peaceful development of cross-Strait ties, held on Wednesday and Thursday in Beijing.
    The forum, organized by the Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, was themed on promoting the integrated development of the two sides and advancing peaceful reunification of China.
    Su Hui, chairwoman of the TDSL, said efforts have been made by the league to build a bridge between the people on both sides of the Strait and promote their mutual understanding and integration, so as to jointly promote reunification.
    Su, also vice chairwoman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's top political advisory body, called for people from both sides to unite together to oppose the secession of "Taiwan independence" and interference by foreign forces.
    Wu Jung-yuan, chairman of Taiwan's Labor Party, said over the past few years, the Taiwan authorities have reneged on the 1992 Consensus, and obstructed normal economic and trade exchanges between the two sides.
    Wu Cheng-tien, chairman of Taiwan's New Party, said the two sides should carry out exchanges and cooperation in economy, trade, culture, religion, science and technology, so as to achieve spiritual compatibility and reunification.
    Wang Zaixi, vice president of National Society of Taiwan Studies, said the mainland has always been the dominant and initiative in resolving the Taiwan question and realizing national reunification.
    The forum, the tenth of its kind, was first initiated by the TDSL Central Committee in 2014.
    The TDSL, founded on Nov 12, 1947, now has about 3,400 members and is one of the eight non-communist parties that participate in state affairs under the leadership of the CPC.

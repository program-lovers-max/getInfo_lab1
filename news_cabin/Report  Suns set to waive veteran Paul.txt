	Report: Suns set to waive veteran Paul
    
    The Phoenix Suns are expected to waive veteran point guard Chris Paul after three seasons with the team, Turner Sports reported Wednesday.
    Paul, 38, is a 12-time All-Star who has been plagued by injuries during the playoffs at various times in his career. He did not play in any of the Suns' last four playoff games against the Denver Nuggets because of a groin strain as Phoenix was eliminated.
    There is one more season remaining on a four-year, $120-million contract Paul signed before the 2020-21 season. He is scheduled to make $15.8 million next season.

	Trump indicted over classified docs
    
    MIAMI â€” Donald Trump said on Thursday that he had been indicted over his handling of classified documents at his Florida estate, the former US president's most serious legal threat yet as a firestorm of criminal investigations imperil his bid for a second White House term.
    It was a remarkable development that makes him the first former president in the country's history to face criminal charges by the federal government that he once oversaw.
    The indictment carries unmistakably grave legal consequences, including the possibility of prison if he is convicted.

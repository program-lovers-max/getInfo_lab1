    A man exonerated after spending more than 22 years in prison for intentional homicide has applied for over 22.67 million yuan ($2.9 million) in State compensation to a court in Henan province.
    The application by Xie Zhehai, a native of Henan's Taikang county in Zhoukou city, was accepted by the Henan High People's Court last week, according to ThePaper.cn, a Shanghai-based news outlet, on Wednesday. There was no word when a decision would be handed down.
    Xie told the media that the compensation includes 10.67 million yuan for his wrongful detention and 10 million yuan for mental anguish resulting from torture during police interrogation.

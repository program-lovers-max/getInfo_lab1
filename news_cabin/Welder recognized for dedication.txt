	Welder recognized for dedication
    From poor rural family to model worker, Zeng Xianhan's short life already packed with achievement
    Zeng Xianhan is always left feeling sweaty after working in the hot, enclosed environment at the shipbuilding factory. And then there's the added discomfort of the occasional spark or bit of molten iron burning his skin through his work clothes.
    Most of the time, the 1.8-meter-all Zeng wears white work clothes and a protective mask and has to squat, kneel or even lie between the pipes of a ship for hours at a time as he does his welding.
    But the electric welder at the Huangpu Wenchong Shipbuilding Co Ltd, a subsidiary of the China State Shipbuilding Corp, never thinks of this as hard work and has no intention of changing his job, which many people might consider tiring and boring.

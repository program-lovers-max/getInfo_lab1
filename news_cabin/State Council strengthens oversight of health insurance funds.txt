	State Council strengthens oversight of health insurance funds
    
    The General Office of the State Council recently released a circular aimed at strengthening oversight of medical security funds.
    Yan Qinghui, deputy director of the National Healthcare Security Administration, said that by the end of April, authorities had launched over 3.4 million inspections on medical institutions, handed out about 1.63 million penalties and retrieved misused funds worth 80.5 billion yuan ($11 billion).
    Meanwhile, medical fraud cases have become harder to detect over the years and the rollout of reform measures, such as streamlining cross-provincial settlements services and trials of long-term care insurance programs, have posed fresh requirements for supervisors, he said during a news conference on Friday.

	In efforts to build a multipolar world, it's the West versus the rest
    
    The explosion in Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnieper River east of the city of Kherson on Tuesday is the tragic consequence of the escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, which could and should be resolved through a cease-fire and talks. The collapse of the dam has led to flooding, putting the lives of tens of thousands of innocent civilians at risk, with Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of being responsible for the disaster.
    Yet this disaster could have been averted if Russia, Ukraine, the United States, NATO and the European Union had heeded the call of China, Brazil and other countries for an immediate cease-fire and holding of dialogue without any preconditions to end the conflict.
    Unfortunately, many in the US, NATO and the EU seem to believe that negotiation is possible only after Ukraine's long-awaited counteroffensive achieves success. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Finland on June 2 that Washington and its allies should not support a cease-fire or peace talks until Ukraine gains strength and can negotiate on its own terms.

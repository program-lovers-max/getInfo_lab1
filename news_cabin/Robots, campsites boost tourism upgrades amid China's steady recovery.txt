    Increased use of new technologies raises efficiency, leads to rising demand for unconventional travel experiences, experts say
    WUHAN — Tourists returning to Chinese scenic spots this year may find many new services on offer — robots performing kung fu, interactive murals and deluxe camps — to name a few. Chinese tourists made 1.22 billion domestic trips in the first quarter of this year, and the country's tourism sector is actively developing new technologies and products to spice up the market.
    The China (Wuhan) Culture and Tourism Expo held during April 21-23 attracted 2,000 exhibitors from home and abroad and offered a glimpse into the shift toward high-quality development.
    A variety of new technologies — from VR tours and robot guides to intelligent wearables — have been stealing the spotlight at the expo, and are vying for a place in Chinese museums and scenic spots.

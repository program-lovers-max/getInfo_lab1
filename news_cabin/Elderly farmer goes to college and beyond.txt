	Elderly farmer goes to college and beyond
    An elderly farmer in Anyang, Henan province, has set a new goal for himself as he is about to graduate from a local vocational and technical college.
    Now he wants to prepare for postgraduate studies at Peking University.
    Liu Yuchun, 74, participated in the national college entrance exam, or
    , five times. He was finally admitted to Puyang Vocational and Technical College in 2020.
    Among other things during his four years of study at the college, Liu memorized more than 4,500 English words. Holding a yellowed English vocabulary book — now tattered and torn, with some parts glued together, and loaded with annotations — Liu said books have helped fuel his hopes and dreams.

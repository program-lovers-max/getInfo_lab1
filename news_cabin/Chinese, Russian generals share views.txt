	Chinese, Russian generals share views
    
    General Liu Zhenli, chief of staff of the Central Military Commission's Joint Staff Department, spoke with his Russian counterpart Army General Valery Gerasimov via video link on Friday, according to China's Ministry of National Defense.
    The two generals exchanged their views on implementing the consensuses reached by state leaders and deepening military cooperation. They also confirmed Russian military forces' participation in a joint exercise held by China's People's Liberation Army, the ministry said in a news release, without giving more details about the conversation.
    According to public information from the Chinese military, this was the first time Liu spoke with any foreign military commander since he was named a member of the Central Military Commission, China's top military authority, in March.

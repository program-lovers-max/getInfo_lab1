	International grape, wine expo opens
    Experts, officials from around world gather in Ningxia for industry exchange
    Wine experts, officials and delegates from wine-producing regions around the world gathered in Yinchuan, Ningxia Hui autonomous region, on Friday, for the 2023 International Conference on Grape and Wine Industries.
    The event, welcoming participants from over 40 countries including delegates from France, Spain, Germany, Chile and other major wine-producing regions, is expected to facilitate the exchange of best practices in wine production and development, thus helping to beef up innovation and growth of China's domestic wine industry.
    The conference is the first of its kind hosted in China — a fast-growing newcomer in the world of wine — and is co-hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ningxia government and the International Organisation of Vine and Wine.

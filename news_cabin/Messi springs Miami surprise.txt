	Messi springs Miami surprise
    Superstar spurns Saudi, Barca offers in favor of Beckham-owned MLS franchise
    MIAMI — Lionel Messi has pulled off his latest stunning feat: He is headed to Major League Soccer and joining Inter Miami.
    After months — years, even — of speculation, Messi on Wednesday finally revealed his decision to join a Miami franchise that has been led by another global soccer icon, David Beckham, since its inception but has yet to make any real splashes on the field.
    That likely will soon change. One of Inter Miami's owners, Jorge Mas, tweeted out a photo of a darkly silhouetted Messi jersey shortly before the Argentinian great revealed his decision in interviews with Spanish news outlets Mundo Deportivo and Sport.

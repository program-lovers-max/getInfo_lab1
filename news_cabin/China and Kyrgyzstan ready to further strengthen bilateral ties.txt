    China is ready to work with Kyrgyzstan to build a community with a shared future featuring good-neighborliness and common prosperity, and to develop all-around cooperation to contribute to both countries' growth and revitalization, President Xi Jinping said on Thursday.
    Xi made the remarks during talks with Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov in Xi'an, Shaanxi province. Japarov is in the provincial capital of Shaanxi to attend the China-Central Asia Summit and pay a state visit to China.
    Xi recalled his two meetings with the Kyrgyz president last year, saying the consensuses he reached with Japarov on bilateral ties and cooperation in various fields are being carried out, injecting strong momentum for the development of the countries' relations.

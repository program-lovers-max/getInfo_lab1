	Samsung showcases new QLED TV technology
    Samsung Electronics on Thursday showcased its latest cutting-edge display technologies in its television products as the South Korean tech company aspires to grab a bigger slice in the Chinese market.
    Its QLED TV (quantum dot light-emitting diodes) is equipped with a neuron quantum dot processor that can provide an artificial intelligence-powered algorithm based on deep learning technology. Therefore, it has significant improvements in terms of image quality, contrast and brightness to their previous technology.
    The company's organic light-emitting diode or OLED TV supports up to a 144Hz refresh rate, offering a smoother visual experience for gaming enthusiasts and features 8K ultra-high-definition technology.
    Statistics from Beijing-based consultancy All View Cloud, or AVC, which specializes in home appliances, showed that TV sales reached 36.34 million units nationwide last year, down 5.2 percent compared with 2021, while related sales revenue totaled 112.3 billion yuan ($15.8 billion), a fall of 12.9 percent year-on-year.
    Experts said new display technologies, such as OLED TVs, QLED TVs and laser TVs and curved-screen TVs, are expected to play an important role in accelerating the upgrade of the display industry.

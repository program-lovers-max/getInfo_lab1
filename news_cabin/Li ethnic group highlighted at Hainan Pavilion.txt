	Li ethnic group highlighted at Hainan Pavilion
    The Hainan Pavilion — themed "Thriving free trade port" — made its debut at the 19th China (Shenzhen) International Cultural Industries Fair at the Shenzhen International Convention and Exhibition Center on Wednesday. The pavilion offers visitors a glimpse of Hainan culture's charm, including the tradition of Li brocade, tea, coffee, rosewood, coconut carving, shell carving and performing arts — all unique to the tropical island province.

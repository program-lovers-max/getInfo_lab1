    Route connecting 393 ports seen as key to national development programs
    The new International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, a major international logistics project, has achieved great success as a recent report shows that its development index in 2022 surged to 135.2 from 122.6 in 2021 and 102 in 2020.
    As a key project mapped out for the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25), the ILSTC is a trade and logistics passage jointly built by provincial-level regions in western China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations member states.
    The land-sea transit route is based on the efficient use of a variety of transportation modes, including railways, highways and waterways.

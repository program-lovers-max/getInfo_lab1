    A draft guideline on fighting cyberbullying began soliciting public opinion on Friday, part of China's new steps to protect people's rights.
    The draft legal document, formulated by the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the country's top judicial authorities, as well as the Ministry of Public Security, has been disclosed online.
    The top court put its postal and email addresses on its website, welcoming individuals and departments to share ideas and suggestions on the draft. The deadline for collecting opinions will end on June 25.

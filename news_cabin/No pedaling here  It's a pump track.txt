    The world's largest pump track park opened in Shenyang, Liaoning province, to increase local residents' enthusiasm for the sport and host more professional competitions.
    Shenyang International Pump Track Park wants to be the venue at which China qualifiers are selected for the 2023 Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) pump track world championships, which is expected to kick off in July.
    A pump track is designed for mountain bikers, skateboarders and BMX riders who generate momentum not by pedaling but by "pumping" motions of the body up and down over jumps, rollers and banked turns.
    "Pump tracks are expected to increase the public's interest in riding and attract more enthusiasts to Shenyang," said Liu Zhe, head of the management department of the China-Germany Equipment Manufacturing Industrial Park, where the pump tracks are located.

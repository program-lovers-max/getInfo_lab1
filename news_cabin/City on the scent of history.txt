    Guardiola's men maul Madrid to move within three games of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup treble
    Manchester City is three games away from making history. And after the stunning rout of Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinals on Wednesday, Pep Guardiola's march toward a treble of trophies feels unstoppable.
    "We are there. We can think about it, can visualize it," the City manager said after his team's 4-0 win at the Etihad Stadium.
    After drawing the first leg 1-1, defending champion Madrid was utterly humbled. Had goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois not produced a string of superb saves, the scoreline would have been so much worse for the 14-time European Cup winner.

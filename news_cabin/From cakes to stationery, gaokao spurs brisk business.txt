    As the nationwide college entrance exam, or gaokao, got underway on Wednesday with a record number of participants taking the test, businesses big and small seized the opportunity to cater to the needs of students and their families, and rake in profits.
    Zeng Jin, who runs a bakery in Harbin, Heilongjiang province, is selling a special variety of mooncake to wish examinees luck. It features the Chinese characters "zhuangyuan". In ancient China, the characters referred to a candidate who finished at the top of the national-level recruitment exam for officials.
    "I came up with this cake five years ago and named it 'zhuangyuan', and it is sold only during gaokao," she said, adding that some of her regular customers prodded her to start making the special mooncakes in early May.

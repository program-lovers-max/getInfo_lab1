    MACAO -- The Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) on Thursday voiced support for the passage of a bill containing amendments to the Law on Safeguarding National Security.
    Noting that safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and development interests is the supreme principle of "one country, two systems," a spokesperson for the office said the Macao SAR government effectively fulfilled its constitutional duty of safeguarding national security by amending the law in the face of changes in internal and external security situations.
    The amended law is in line with the "one country, two systems" principle, stipulations in the country's Constitution and the Basic Law of the Macao SAR, and the requirements for implementing the overall concept of national security, the spokesperson said.
    The passage of the amendments will help further improve the legal system and mechanism of the SAR for safeguarding national security, further prevent and punish criminal activities endangering national security, and further guarantee the rights and freedoms of Macao residents and a sound business environment in Macao, the spokesperson said.
    Macao's tradition of rule of law had been respected during the process and the legislative experiences of other parts of the world were drawn on, the spokesperson said, adding that the legal basis for the amendments is sufficient, and the procedures are scientific and democratic.
    All sectors of the society have actively participated in the process and more than 90 percent of public opinions supported the revision.
    The spokesperson stressed that the liaison office will continue to firmly support the Macao SAR government in fully and accurately implementing the revised law and effectively preventing, stopping and punishing criminal activities endangering national security in accordance with the law.
    The office will also support the SAR government in further improving the legal system and enforcement mechanism for safeguarding national security, strengthening publicity and education on the overall situation and legal system for safeguarding national security, constantly raising awareness of Macao residents in this regard, so as to promote the steady and sustained development of "one country, two systems" with Macao characteristics.

	University Games set for start of torch relay
    
    The official flame for the 31st Summer World University Games was flown from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, to Beijing on Thursday for the torch relay due to start at the weekend.
    Under escort, the flame, carried in sealed pots, was taken aboard a plane specially named Universiade at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport.
    As the official partner of the University Games, Chengdu-headquartered Sichuan Airlines selected eight crew members to transport the flame, said Wang Ke, general manager of the airline's cabin service department.

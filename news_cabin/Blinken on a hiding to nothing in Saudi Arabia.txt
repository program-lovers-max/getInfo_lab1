	Blinken on a hiding to nothing in Saudi Arabia
	2023-06-09 00:00
    
    After CIA Director William Burns' trip in April and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's in May, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Saudi Arabia for a third visit to the country this year by a senior official of the Joe Biden administration.
    In public, these visits, in Washington's words, are reconciliatory moves to repair and stabilize the US' commitment to its strategic partnership with the Middle East powerhouse as well as peace and stability in the broader region. In private, US sources have revealed a likely more imperative priority on their government's agenda â€” to counter China's growing influence in the area.
    Blinken tried to lower anticipations about Saudi Arabia and Israel normalizing relations prior to his trip, one of his most important topics in discussions with his Saudi hosts. The two sides did agree to continue discussing the matter. But just as he conceded earlier, it may not happen any time soon.

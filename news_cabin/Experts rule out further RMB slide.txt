    Although the Chinese currency renminbi faced some downward pressure in the past few trading days, there is little room for it to head further south in light of the economic recovery that is on track, said experts on Thursday.
    In offshore trading Wednesday, the yuan dipped 0.3 percent to 7.0201 per dollar at one point, while onshore trading saw the renminbi's exchange rate against the greenback slide 0.4 percent to 7.0026 once, according to Bloomberg data.
    It is the first time in five months that both the indicators breached the 7-per-dollar threshold. Onshore RMB touched 7.0145 and offshore RMB 7.0323 Thursday afternoon.

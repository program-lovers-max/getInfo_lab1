	Honduran President Xiomara Castro visits China
    
    Honduran President Xiomara Castro arrived in Shanghai on Friday morning, starting her six-day visit to China.
    This is Castro's first visit to China since the two nations officially established diplomatic relations on March 26.
    Castro received a warm welcome when arriving at her hotel in Shanghai, where the Shanghai Old Jazz Band played a popular Honduran song "Honduras Cancion y Vida" (Honduras Song and Life) to welcome her.
    The next leg of her visit will be Beijing, where the two heads of state will have a "historic meeting to jointly chart the course for further growth of bilateral relations", according to a news briefing by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday.

    In recent years, people-to-people exchanges between China and the five Central Asian countries — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — have become increasingly frequent.
    Official data showed a constant increase in the number of Central Asian students studying in China, growing from over 11,000 in 2010 to nearly 30,000 in 2018, with an average annual growth rate of 12.33 percent.
    As the China-Central Asia Summit begins, students from Central Asian countries are looking forward to closer ties between China and Central Asia. They also express their willingness to become envoys of friendship and cooperation between China and their home countries.
